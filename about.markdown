My name is Sarah.  Welcome to my site!  

I am a Senior Information Security Analyst based out of St. Louis, Missouri.  I've done a little bit of everything in the security realm, including security monitoring and incident response, engineering, governance and compliance, vulnerability management, pen testing, and incident response.  Currently, I focus on orchestration and automation.

I'm obsessed with Python and have been known to enlighten my colleagues with random facts from various PEPs.  I sometimes reverse engineer things in my free time.

Two highlights of my career so far have been passing my OSCP (in March 2018) and my GREM (in December 2019).  Thanks for visiting my site.  Hope you enjoy!
