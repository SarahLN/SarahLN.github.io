# Holiday Hack Challenge 2019
This christmas season I attended [Kringlecon 2: Turtle Doves](https://2019.kringlecon.com/invite) at the North Pole and participated in the [SANS Holiday Hack Challenge](https://holidayhackchallenge.com/2019/).  As always, it was a fantastic experience filled with much fun and learning.  I want to send a huge thanks to the Counter Hack team and SANS for putting on such a great event!

Without further ado, here's my experience.

## Arriving at the North Pole
Upon arriving at the North Pole, I was greeted by Santa himself.

> Welcome to the North Pole and KringleCon 2!
>
> Last year, KringleCon hosted over 17,500 attendees and my castle got a little crowded.
>
> We moved the event to Elf University (Elf U for short), the North Poleâ€™s largest venue.
>
> Please feel free to explore, watch talks, and enjoy the con!
