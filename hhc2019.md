# Holiday Hack Challenge 2019
This christmas season I attended [Kringlecon 2: Turtle Doves](https://2019.kringlecon.com/invite) at the North Pole and participated in the [SANS Holiday Hack Challenge](https://holidayhackchallenge.com/2019/).  As always, it was a fantastic experience filled with much fun and learning.  I want to send a huge thanks to the Counter Hack team and SANS for putting on such a great event!

Without further ado, here's my experience.

## Arriving at the North Pole
Upon arriving at the North Pole, I was greeted by Santa himself.

> Welcome to the North Pole and KringleCon 2!
>
> Last year, KringleCon hosted over 17,500 attendees and my castle got a little crowded.
>
> We moved the event to Elf University (Elf U for short), the North Poleâ€™s largest venue.
>
> Please feel free to explore, watch talks, and enjoy the con!

With this conversation with Santa, I unlocked my first [narrative](#narrative).  I also came across my first [terminal challenge](#terminal_challenges).  KringleCon 2 is officially under way!

In the rest of this report, I will walk through each terminal challenge and objective put forth before me.  Cheers and happy hacking!

## Terminal Challenges[](#terminal_challenges)

| Elf                | Name                      | Location           |
|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
|Bushy Evergreen     | [Escape ed](#escape_ed)   | Train Station      |

### Escape ed[](#escape_ed)
In the Train Station, Busy Evergreen introduces us to the Escape Ed terminal challenge.

> Hi, I'm Bushy Evergreen. Welcome to Elf U!
>
> I'm glad you're here. I'm the target of a terrible trick.
>
> Pepper Minstix is at it again, sticking me in a text editor.
>
> Pepper is forcing me to learn ed.
>
> Even the hint is ugly. Why can't I just use Gedit?
>
> Please help me just quit the grinchy thing.

**Hint**: [ed Editor Basics](http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs249/Resources/ed_is_the_standard_text_editor.html)

Upon entering the terminal, we were dropped into the ed editor, a linux-based editor similar to vi. To complete the challenge, we must exit the ed editor.

To exit the ed editor, we simply type "wq" and press enter.  Upon doing this, the editor exits and we get the "You did it! Congratulations!" message indicating that we completed the challenge successfully!

Completing this terminal gave us the achievement "Escape Ed".

Bushy rewarded us greatly for helping him with this task, including dropping two hints that will come in handy on [Objective 3](#objective3)

> Wow, that was much easier than I'd thought.
> 
> Maybe I don't need a clunky GUI after all!
> 
> Have you taken a look at the password spray attack artifacts?
> 
> I'll bet that DeepBlueCLI tool is helpful.
> 
> You can check it out on GitHub.
> 
> It was written by that Eric Conrad.
> 
> He lives in Maine - not too far from here!
